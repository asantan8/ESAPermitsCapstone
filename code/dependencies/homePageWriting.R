          Therefore, there are data attributes that lack consistency and missing information. For example, early permit 
          applications were not required to enter specific information regarding location, HUC number, take action, and so on. 
          As we are aware of this, we will either provide a quality check to fill in gaps based on provided information or will 
          not include these values/permits into our project as they are not complete/missing necessary information. Additionally, 
          in the StreamName section, NOAA allowed permit applicants to provide the name of the waterbody they planned to work with. 
          As this is a textbox entry rather than a drop down with provided names, information on the same waterbody can be unnecessarily
          duplicated with alternative names or descriptions. Therefore, we manually adjusted the waterbody entries to ensure no duplication 
          occurred for waterbody names and to provide more consistency across the nomenclature. "),

          However, some organizations or projects can opt out or neglect to report on the actual take and mortality. As a result, 
          these projects are not included in our analyses due to lack of data. Thus, a limitation of this unreported data is we

          to reflect any changes to their boundaries. Decisions were made using an unpublished document that 
          summarizes HUC 8 code changes up until 2018 (Hanson et al. 2018). Some of these changes ran on
