#' @title createMapDF
#'
#' @description Creates data frames for input into Leaflet map.
#' @param data Filtered permit data frame with TotalMorts column already created.
#' @param spatialData Polygon spatial data for HUC 8's in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California.
#' Recommended to use the data that comes with this package from the Watershed Boundary Dataset (Made 
#' and maintained by the USGS).
#' @param createTakVar Logical indicating whether total take (sum of lethal and non-lethal take) data 
#' should be summarized instead of only lethal take data. Defaults to TRUE indicating that total take 
#' data should be summarized
#' @return A spatial data frame with the total amount of take or moralities for each unique ESU, huc8, 
#' LifeStage, and Production combination.
